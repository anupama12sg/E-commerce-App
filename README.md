# E-Commerce App

# Roadmap:
 1. Install [Vite + React](https://vite.dev/guide/). Create a new folder "Frontend" and do "npm install". To run the project, "npm run dev". (Refer docs)
 2. Install [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite). (Refer docs)
 3. Clear files like App.jsx, App.css, index.css. Delete Vite & React logo to add the project's logo & title.
